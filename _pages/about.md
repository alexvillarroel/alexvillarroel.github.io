I am a geophysicist with a passion for programming and seismology. I am currently pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in geophysics at the University of Concepcion.<br />

I am developing a tool for stochastic earthquake rupture generation, and its multiple uses in both tsunami and seismic hazard analysis.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Solid Earth topics and Tsunami processes.<br />
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter and GIS. 

In this web page is the content of my research, courses and assistantships that I have provided to the university.
